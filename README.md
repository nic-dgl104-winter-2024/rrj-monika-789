# Research and Reflection Journal Assignment

### Week 8

## Activity 1:RESEARCH A NEW LANGUAGE

### Haskell

This is a group activity that involves researching one of three programming languages: Processing, Haskell, and Lua, to answer specific questions.

 Haskell is a versatile programming language known for its static typing, pure functional approach, and features like type inference and lazy evaluation. Originally designed for teaching, research, and industrial applications, it focuses on mathematical functions and avoids changing data. Widely used in academia and industry, Haskell was the 28th most searched language for tutorials on Google as of May 2021.

#### What is the language used for?

Haskell is known for its use in research, education, and compiler development. Its expressive, type-safe nature makes it suitable for concurrent and parallel programming, and it has frameworks for web development. While not as mainstream, Haskell finds applications in data analysis, scientific computing, and the financial sector. The language has a strong open-source community and is valued for its focus on correctness and elegant code.

#### Who uses the language?

 Haskell is utilized by researchers, educators, and developers across academia, with applications in teaching, research, and compiler development. Its frameworks like Yesod and Scotty find use in web development, and its expressive features attract those in concurrent programming, data analysis, and scientific computing. While not as widespread as mainstream languages, Haskell has dedicated open-source contributors and users who appreciate its correctness and elegance. Notably, companies like Facebook and GitHub have employed Haskell in specific projects, showcasing its versatility, and Standard Chartered has reportedly used it in financial software development.

#### What are some useful resources?
  
For learning Haskell, useful resources include the official Haskell website (haskell.org) for documentation and tutorials, "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!" by Miran Lipovaƒça for a beginner-friendly book, and the "Haskell Programming from First Principles" by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki for a comprehensive guide. Online platforms like Haskell.org, GitHub, and Stack Overflow provide a community-driven support network. To practice, Exercism.io and HackerRank offer Haskell-specific coding challenges. The Haskell Book and Real World Haskell are additional valuable texts. For staying updated, podcasts like The Haskell Weekly and blogs like "Haskell for All" offer insights.

#### Why are these specific resources useful?

These resources are valuable for learning Haskell due to their diverse offerings. The official Haskell website provides essential documentation and tutorials for beginners. "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!" serves as an accessible introduction, while "Haskell Programming from First Principles" offers a thorough and structured approach. Online platforms like GitHub and Stack Overflow provide community support, and Exercism.io and HackerRank offer hands-on coding practice. The Haskell Book and Real World Haskell deepen understanding, while podcasts like The Haskell Weekly and blogs like "Haskell for All" keep learners updated with insights and discussions. Together, these resources cater to various learning styles and levels of expertise in Haskell.


 ### Reflection

This activity proved to be an effective practice in refining research skills. Having questions in mind before starting the research process proved crucial in staying focused and ensuring a thorough exploration of the topic. It helped us look into many aspects, making our understanding of the topic deeper and more complete and, using various websites during the search provides diverse information and viewpoints.

## Activity 2:Write a user story

### User Stories

* As a user, I can see my recent video calls, including who I talked to and how long we chatted.
* As a user, I can see a list of participants in the ongoing video call and have the option to add participants as needed.
* As a user, I can do things during the call, like mute myself, turn my camera off or on and, switch the camera front or back.
* As a user, I can share pictures, videos, or files while we're on the call.
* As a user, I can let others see what's on my screen, which is handy for showing presentations or helping with tech problems.

### Acceptance criteria
* Group call-
     Users with appropriate permissions should be able to remove participants from the call.
* Share stuff-
    The sharing feature should support a variety of file formats and sizes.


## Choose a language for Community Code

I've chosen JavaScript for our community code project as it aligns with my current semester's coursework. The language is new to me, and I believe working on it will enhance my understanding of JavaScript as I progress through my course. I'm excited about the opportunity to learn and grow in this programming language.


## Star GitHub topics and repositories of interest

I visited GitHub Topics and I've starred topics that are perfect for beginners diving into JavaScript basics, especially those focused on project-based learning and first-contributions.

###  Week 9

## Activity 1: Read the Community Code Assignment

According to the guidelines of the Community Code Assignment, there are certain steps we should follow before contributing to a community code project. Firstly, we need to find a project that matches our skills and interests. Participating in an open-source project provides an opportunity to learn from professionals and work for real-world development companies. It also allows us to be a part of a community where people of all skill levels collaborate, exchange ideas, and strive to improve things. We should start by examining the open issues on the project's GitHub page. These issues require attention such as fixing bugs or adding new features. We can offer our support by doing things such as writing documentation, reporting issues, suggesting improvements, or even fixing problems ourselves. By following these steps, we can make a meaningful contribution to the open-source community while enhancing our skills and knowledge as a developer.

## Activity 2: Read the Research and Reflection Guide

I looked at the instructions provided in the readme.md file. It showed me how to organize my journal entries for each week's activities and what details to include at the end of the course. It gave me clear, step-by-step directions on how to tackle the project in small parts.


## Activity 3: How to Contribute to Open Source

Contributing to open-source projects is a great way to improve our software skills and connect with a community of like-minded individuals. To get started, we should check out the project's documentation, especially the README file. This file contains valuable information about the project's objectives, features, and how to participate. It also includes instructions, coding standards, and best practices for contributing to ensure that our work meets the project's quality standards and criteria, avoiding unnecessary work. Reading the documentation helps us identify which tasks or issues have already been addressed and which ones still need attention, providing opportunities to contribute. Remember that contributing is not just about writing code; we can also help by updating documentation, reporting issues, or assisting others with their code. This guide will teach us how to find suitable tasks and projects with supportive communities, making it easier for us to get involved and make a difference.
