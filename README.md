### Week 8

## Activity 1:RESEARCH A NEW LANGUAGE

### Haskell

This is a group activity that involves researching one of three programming languages: Processing, Haskell, and Lua, to answer specific questions.

 Haskell is a versatile programming language known for its static typing, pure functional approach, and features like type inference and lazy evaluation. Originally designed for teaching, research, and industrial applications, it focuses on mathematical functions and avoids changing data. Widely used in academia and industry, Haskell was the 28th most searched language for tutorials on Google as of May 2021.

#### What is the language used for?

Haskell is known for its use in research, education, and compiler development. Its expressive, type-safe nature makes it suitable for concurrent and parallel programming, and it has frameworks for web development. While not as mainstream, Haskell finds applications in data analysis, scientific computing, and the financial sector. The language has a strong open-source community and is valued for its focus on correctness and elegant code.

#### Who uses the language?

 Haskell is utilized by researchers, educators, and developers across academia, with applications in teaching, research, and compiler development. Its frameworks like Yesod and Scotty find use in web development, and its expressive features attract those in concurrent programming, data analysis, and scientific computing. While not as widespread as mainstream languages, Haskell has dedicated open-source contributors and users who appreciate its correctness and elegance. Notably, companies like Facebook and GitHub have employed Haskell in specific projects, showcasing its versatility, and Standard Chartered has reportedly used it in financial software development.

#### What are some useful resources?
  
For learning Haskell, useful resources include the official Haskell website (haskell.org) for documentation and tutorials, "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!" by Miran Lipovaƒça for a beginner-friendly book, and the "Haskell Programming from First Principles" by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki for a comprehensive guide. Online platforms like Haskell.org, GitHub, and Stack Overflow provide a community-driven support network. To practice, Exercism.io and HackerRank offer Haskell-specific coding challenges. The Haskell Book and Real World Haskell are additional valuable texts. For staying updated, podcasts like The Haskell Weekly and blogs like "Haskell for All" offer insights.

#### Why are these specific resources useful?

These resources are valuable for learning Haskell due to their diverse offerings. The official Haskell website provides essential documentation and tutorials for beginners. "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!" serves as an accessible introduction, while "Haskell Programming from First Principles" offers a thorough and structured approach. Online platforms like GitHub and Stack Overflow provide community support, and Exercism.io and HackerRank offer hands-on coding practice. The Haskell Book and Real World Haskell deepen understanding, while podcasts like The Haskell Weekly and blogs like "Haskell for All" keep learners updated with insights and discussions. Together, these resources cater to various learning styles and levels of expertise in Haskell.


 ### Reflection

This activity proved to be an effective practice in refining research skills. Having questions in mind before starting the research process proved crucial in staying focused and ensuring a thorough exploration of the topic. It helped us look into many aspects, making our understanding of the topic deeper and more complete and, using various websites during the search provides diverse information and viewpoints.
