## Project Name: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

This project aims to create a responsive Rock, Paper, Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML will structure the game layout, CSS will style it for visual appeal 
and responsiveness, and JavaScript will handle player input and game logic. This classic game will be enjoyable on any device, providing entertainment for users of all ages.

### Key Feaures:

Responsive Design: The game interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's and computer's scores, updating them dynamically with each round.
Randomized Computer Choice: The computer's choice (rock, paper, or scissors) is generated randomly for each round, adding unpredictability to the game.
Reset Functionality: A reset button allows the player to reset the game, clearing scores and resetting hand images to their initial state.
Animation: The game features animation effects (shake) to provide an engaging and interactive experience when the player and computer make their choices.

### Summary of issues examined:

The issue identified is that when the buttons are rapidly clicked, multiple inputs can be registered for subsequent rounds before the current round is resolved.
This can lead to unexpected behavior and disrupt the flow of the game.


### Detailed discussion of issues contributed to:

I worked on a specific issue related to preventing multiple button clicks in my Rock, Paper, Scissors game. I explored different methods, including using the disabled attribute of HTML
buttons and adding/removing event listeners.I found a solution by immediately disabling the buttons after a player makes a selection and re-enabling them after displaying
the round outcome. This approach ensured that only one round is processed at a time, preventing confusion and unexpected results. I also looked into other websites and tutorials such
as MDN Web Docs and Stack Overflow to gather insights and examples on how to handle button clicks and prevent multiple selections in JavaScript.


The solution involves two functions: disableButton() and ResetButtonsState().

In the disableButton() function, the buttons for rock, paper, and scissors are disabled immediately after a player makes a selection. This prevents the player from clicking them
again until the current round is resolved. The function retrieves the button elements by their IDs and sets their disabled property to true, effectively disabling them.

The ResetButtonsState() function is responsible for re-enabling the buttons after the outcome of the round is displayed and the game resets. This function retrieves the button
elements again and sets their disabled property back to false, allowing the player to make selections for the next round.

Together, these functions ensure that only one selection can be made at a time, preventing multiple button clicks and ensuring a smoother gameplay experience for the player.


### Code:

#### app.js:

Updated solution code
```
 // enable buttons again
  ResetButtonsState();
```
```

/* Disable button untill */
function disableButton() {

  // Get the button element by its ID
  var rockBtn = document.getElementById("rockButton");
  var paperBtn = document.getElementById("paperButton");
  var scissorBtn = document.getElementById("scissorButton");

  // Disable the button
  rockBtn.disabled = true;
  paperBtn.disabled = true;
  scissorBtn.disabled = true;
}

function ResetButtonsState()
{
  var rockBtn = document.getElementById("rockButton");
  var paperBtn = document.getElementById("paperButton");
  var scissorBtn = document.getElementById("scissorButton");

  // Disable the button
  rockBtn.disabled = false;
  paperBtn.disabled = false;
  scissorBtn.disabled = false;
}
```


### Code review and Outcomes:








### Reflection:

Upon reflection, the issue of preventing multiple button clicks was successfully resolved. Initially, the game experienced the problem of processing multiple rounds simultaneously
when players clicked buttons rapidly, leading to confusion and unexpected outcomes. The roadblock faced was finding an effective way to disable the buttons temporarily after a
player's selection until the current round was resolved. This was overcome by implementing the disableButton() function to disable the buttons immediately after a click, preventing
additional selections until the current round was completed. Additionally, the ResetButtonsState() function ensured that the buttons were re-enabled after the round outcome was
displayed, allowing for subsequent rounds to proceed smoothly. Through careful implementation and testing, the solution effectively addressed the issue, resulting in a more controlled
and enjoyable gameplay experience for players.


### Discussion of next steps:

The next step is to conduct thorough testing of the button disabling functionality to ensure it works reliably across different scenarios and devices. Gathering feedback from users
will provide valuable insights into any usability issues or areas for improvement. Additionally, documenting the implemented solution will serve as a reference for future development
and maintenance. Finally, considering potential enhancements to further improve the gameplay experience, based on user feedback and project requirements, will be essential for the
game's continued success.
